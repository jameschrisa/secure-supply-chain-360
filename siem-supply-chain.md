# SIEM Design for Supply Chain Management

## Summary
Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) for supply chain management involves the collection, analysis, and correlation of security events and data across the entire supply chain network. It aims to provide real-time visibility, threat detection, and incident response capabilities to protect the complex ecosystem of suppliers, partners, and logistics operations.
